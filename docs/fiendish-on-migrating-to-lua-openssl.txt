[EDIT] I've since switched from LuaSec to Lua-openssl because luasec was not thread-safe and the lua-openssl creator actually pays attention to pull requests and comments.

The complete set of files related to sockets, ssl, and threading should be:

MUSHclient/openssl.dll
MUSHclient/llthreads.dll (for asynchronous background sockets)
--MUSHclient/ssleay32.dll
--MUSHclient/libeay32.dll
MUSHclient/socket/*
MUSHclient/mime/*
MUSHclient/lua/async.lua (for asynchronous background sockets)
MUSHclient/lua/ssl.lua
MUSHclient/lua/socket.lua
MUSHclient/lua/ssl/*

You might also need to replace your lua dll with mine (there are two), since I use LuaJIT instead of PUC-Rio Lua, and then also include the msvcr100 dll if you don't have it in your system32 directory.
