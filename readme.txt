Ruthgul's collection of MUSHclient plugins for Materia Magica.

A few are my own, others are contributions from other players, most are adapted from other games/authors.

For more details, check the old site:

... though all the screen captures and scripts are broken ^_^;
... someday it will be migrated to the Wiki!

~ Notice: plugins_updater_v2 may need to be updated manually, once, because of the migration to github ~

All scripts written in Lua.
