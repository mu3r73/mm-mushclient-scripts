To update plugins_updater_v3, and enable it to work with this github repo:

1. close MUSHclient

2. make a backup copy of your current MUSHclient directory, in case the following process fails

3. download the file:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mu3r73/mm-mushclient-scripts/master/res/plugins_updater_v3.zip

4. extract plugins_updater_v3.zip (downloaded in step 3), to your MUSHclient directory - when asked about overwriting old files, answer yes

5. in MUSHclient:

   a) open the plugins window (by pressing ctrl + shift + p)

   b) locate and select plugins_updater_v3

   c) click "ReInstall"


Once you've done this, it should auto-scan your local MUSHclient plugins, and offer you the option to update them.

To do so, after it's done scanning, type:
update plugins lastlist
(or click the hyperlink/s provided by the plugin)


Notice:
- the new plugins_updater_v3 uses lua-openssl (instead of LuaSec), and lua-llthreads2, and we're also replacing standard Lua with LuaJIT
